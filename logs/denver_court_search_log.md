## Analysis

### Possible Explanations

1. **Case Not Yet Entered in System**: The judgment may have been entered very recently (within the past 24-48 hours) and has not yet been uploaded to the online docket system.

2. **Incorrect Case Classification**: The case may be classified differently than "S" (Small Claims). Possible alternatives:
   - **C**: Civil (General)
   - **CV**: Civil (Other)
   - **M**: Miscellaneous

3. **Different Court Division**: The case may be filed in:
   - Denver County Court (not District Court)
   - Denver - Juvenile
   - Denver - Probate

4. **Case Number Format Issue**: The case number "25S00165" may need to be searched differently:
   - Without the "S" prefix
   - As "2025S00165" (full year)
   - In a different sequence format

5. **Case Not Yet Filed**: The judgment may still be pending formal entry into the court system.

### Critical Assessment

- Send legally binding ultimatums

### Recommended Next Steps

1. **Contact User**: Request copies of:
   - Judgment document
   - Case filing receipt
