## Key Findings

### 1. Funktion-One Equipment Confirmed

This confirms they are actively advertising and using Funktion-One equipment—the same equipment disputed as belonging to Kanyon Walker's estate.

Recent events documented:
- **Boiler Room Afters** (September 28, 2024) - at Nova Studios, 5690 Logan Street

- Multiple other after-hours events with "Funktion-One Sound by Plutonian Sound"

### 3. Commercial Lease (Not Ownership)
The LoopNet listing suggests this is a commercial property available for lease/sale, indicating:
- Nova Studios likely **leases** the space (does not own)
- Cannot place judgment lien on property (they don't own it)
- **BUT**: Can garnish business accounts and seize equipment on premises

### 4. Business Structure
- **Nova Studios**: Venue/event space/recording studio
- **Ploutonion Sound LLC**: Sound equipment company
- Both operated by John O'Connor and Alex Knuckey

## Enforcement Implications

### ✅ Can Do:
1. **Writ of Replevin**: Seize Funktion-One equipment at 5690 Logan St, Unit A
2. **Writ of Garnishment**: Garnish business bank accounts
3. **Payment Processor Garnishment**: Garnish Square, Stripe, or other processors
4. **Equipment Seizure**: Sheriff can enter leased premises to seize judgment debtor's property

### ❌ Cannot Do:
1. **Property Lien**: They lease, don't own the building
2. **Landlord Garnishment**: Landlord is not responsible for tenant's debts

### 🎯 Best Strategy:
1. **Equipment Seizure**: Highest priority—recover Funktion-One system (worth $25k+)
2. **Bank Garnishment**: Capture cash flow from events
3. **Processor Garnishment**: Intercept ticket sales revenue
4. **Regulatory Pressure**: Code violations to pressure settlement

## Equipment Documentation Needed

From Instagram and event listings, we need to document:
1. **Photos of Funktion-One equipment** at Nova Studios
2. **Event listings** advertising "Funktion-One Sound"
3. **Rental advertisements** for the equipment

5. **Witness statements** from Kanyon Walker estate

This documentation will support the Replevin action proving:
- Equipment is at 5690 Logan St, Unit A
- Defendants are using and profiting from stolen equipment
- Equipment belongs to Kanyon Walker estate
